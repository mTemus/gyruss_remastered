This project was about remaking [Gyruss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gyruss) NES console version to an android version. Main objective of this project was to reproduce original game as accurately as possible.

### Gameplay

### Original content
To stand original, to create this game we used original sprites and we had handly re-drawn some of them, because they were not able to be found in the Internet. We also used original soundtrack and sound effects.

### Game length
This remake contains two levels divided on stages (like originals), but second lvl has not boss stage included. Game is repetitive, so we've implemented most of it's mechanics, because as further, only sprites and background music changes.

### Third party assets
The only asset that we used from third parties was a [Bezier Curve Editor](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/bezier-curve-editor-11278). It was used to create paths for enemies, on which they were moving in and out.
